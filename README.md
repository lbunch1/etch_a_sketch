The goal of this project is to create a square grid that will assign a fill color to any div that recieves the mouseOver event. The size of the grid will default to 16x16 but a user input will allow a grid of up to 100x100 to be generated.

Personal Goal: add a color picker that allows the user to choose the color the cursor draws.
